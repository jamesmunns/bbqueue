//! "Coordination" functionality
//!
//! This trait is used to coordinate between Producers and Consumers.
//!
//! Unless you are on an embedded target without Compare and Swap atomics, e.g.
//! `cortex-m0`/`thumbv6m`, you almost certainly want to use the [`cas`] version
//! of coordination.
//!
//! The `cas` module is toggled automatically based on `#[cfg(target_has_atomic = "ptr")]`.
